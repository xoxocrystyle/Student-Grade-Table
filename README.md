A student or teacher can use this web application to keep track of grades and courses. Its UI is with HTML5 and Bootstrap. Javascript's jQuery library was used to manipulate the DOM as well as handle AJAX calls to the Node.js server. The Node.js server handles all the queries made to the mySQL database.
